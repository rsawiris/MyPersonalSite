        <h2 class="FBA">Amazon FBA Online Business:</h2>
    </div>
        <p class="text">During my first semester of college, I began my
            own Amazon FBA business. At the time, I was taking an online
            course teaching the process of starting an Amazon business 
            from scratch. This course was seperate from my university 
            courses but it gave me the knowledge and ability to start my 
            FBA business. During a three year process, I created and developed
            two online brands (pictured to the right) from start to finish. 
            This process included researching online markets, communicating 
            with Chinese suppliers and US-based logistics companies as well 
            as developing websites for the products while also marketing them
            on social media. Although I am no longer selling these products 
            today, I learned a lot about conducting business online like the 
            importance in creating a product that truly solves a problem  
            a target customer may have (whether they realize they have the 
            problem or not). I also learned of the importance of creating value 
            and how doing that can leave a lasting impact on someone. All in all,
            it was a worthwile venture and definitley something I want to start again
            in the future. This time while also applying the coding skills I have learned 
            in the process!

        <h2 class="FBA">Social Media Productions:</h2>
        <p class="text">Another project I worked on in the past was in creating 
            social media content. In doing so, there were two main areas that I 
            had focused my content creation on. The first was in my online brands.
            I had spent some time focusing on creating social media reels for the 
            products I was selling. This process involved scripting, video creation,
            and editing which I did as a way to market my products. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">The second area of focus was on my fitness journey. At this point,
            I had been weightligting consistently for a year and a half and decided to start
            a social media page where I would share tips and tricks for fat loss and muscle 
            building. The reason I decided to start this endeavor was because of all the false
            information on the internet today in the fitness industry regarding fat loss and 
            muscle building. Many beginners are confused and unsure of the best route to take 
            and I remember being in that position and it's a shame that people in this industry 
            try to make a profit by confusing beginners. Because of that, I started a social media
            page where I would share what I've learned over the years and it was a real fun process!
