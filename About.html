            <h2>Weight Lifting</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="text">When starting my days, one of the first things 
                I like to do is lift weights. Weight lifting provides a variety 
                of benefits to overall physical and mental health and I find that by 
                starting my day off with a weight lifting session, the rest of my day 
                is set up for conquering. The mental clarity it provides allows 
                me to live the rest of the day active and focused. I began my 
                weight lifting journey in April of 2021 and have fallen in love ever 
                since. I lift weights six days out of the week and keep my diet centered 
                around the effort I put into the gym. In keeping an overall well-balanced
                and nutritious diet, I am able to accomplish the tasks of my day because of
                the energy it provides.

            <h2 class="two">Music Production</h2>
            <p class="text2"> 
                Music has always been something I have enjoyed. Whether it's 
                listening to or making, music has always been therapeutic 
                for me and thus something I love! I began producing music in 
                January of 2022 and have created a list of tracks that I 
                enjoy listening to. One day I wish to take things a step 
                further by recording my music and sharing it with the world 
                on an album, but for now I like the process of creating a work 
                of art and belieivng it is one of a kind. One of the main questions
                I get when I tell people I make music is "What genre of music do you 
                make?" It's ironic because I like all kinds of music and yet when it 
                comes to my own music, I really have no idea. The general answer I give 
                people is "I usually just make whatever comes to mind" or "it really 
                depends on how I'm feeling that day when I sit down to make it". While I can't put 
                a genre on my music, I can definitley say that making music has been a 
                worthwhile investment.</p>

            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <p class="text">Hiking was something I began in high school as a Boy Scout. 
                A few times a year we'd plan three-day camping trips or day trips to San 
                Francisco and it always involved a form of hiking (although sometimes we 
                would be carrying 50+ pounds of camping gear which made it painful). 
                Needless to say, it has been something I have kept as a habit even after 
                high school. The scenic view of nature itself can be quite the sight. One
                of my favroite hiking trails has to be Sierra Road in the heart of Sillicon
                Valley itself, San Jose. Pictured to the right, this trail in the Sierra 
                Vista Open Space Preserve features a 4.6-mile hike that, given the beautiful 
                view of the entire city of San Jose, almost seems endless. As you progress
                through the hike, the mountainous landscape creates what appears to the eyes
                as an optical illusion that is visually stunning and refreshing to see. It 
                is one of the many reasons I enjoy hiking and make sure to go on one every 
                once in a while!
